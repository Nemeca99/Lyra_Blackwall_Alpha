# Kitchen Staff System - Ollama-Managed Public Memory

## 🧑‍🍳 Michelin-Star AI Kitchen Architecture

This system implements the **Kitchen Staff** component of your Michelin-star AI kitchen architecture. The Kitchen Staff manages public memory, indexing, and provides ingredients to the Executive Chef (LM Studio).

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### **Kitchen Staff (Ollama) - This System**
- **Location**: `D:\Books\.Material\Implementation\05_Lyra\Systems\Memory_Systems`
- **Role**: Manages all raw ingredients (memory indexing), keeps inventory (public memory pool), and handles kitchen logistics
- **AI**: Ollama (Qwen2.5 - Linear AI)
- **Function**: "Here's what we have, here's the menu"

### **Executive Chef (LM Studio)**
- **Location**: `D:\Books\DiscordBot`
- **Role**: Personal chef who knows what the user wants
- **AI**: LM Studio (DeepSeek - Recursive AI)
- **Function**: Creates personalized responses from ingredients

### **Discord (The Restaurant)**
- **Role**: Customer interface and delivery mechanism
- **Function**: Handles orders and delivers responses in requested format (text, image, video, music)

## 📁 System Components

### **Core Files:**

1. **`kitchen_staff.py`** - Main Kitchen Staff system
   - Manages public memory storage and retrieval
   - Generates embeddings using Ollama
   - Prepares ingredient packages for the Executive Chef
   - Handles emotion detection and context tagging

2. **`discord_kitchen_interface.py`** - Discord interface
   - Connects Kitchen Staff to Discord (the restaurant)
   - Monitors public chat messages
   - Processes user interactions
   - Coordinates with kitchen operations

3. **`kitchen_orchestrator.py`** - Main coordinator
   - Orchestrates communication between all components
   - Manages order queue and processing
   - Coordinates Kitchen Staff and Executive Chef
   - Handles system health monitoring

4. **`test_kitchen_system.py`** - Test suite
   - Tests all Kitchen Staff components
   - Verifies system functionality
   - Validates integration points

## 🚀 Getting Started

### **Prerequisites:**
- Python 3.8+
- Ollama installed and running
- Required packages: `ollama`, `faiss`, `numpy`, `discord.py`

### **Installation:**
```bash
pip install ollama faiss-cpu numpy discord.py
```

### **Configuration:**
1. Update `discord_kitchen_interface.py` with your Discord bot token
2. Set the target channel ID for monitoring
3. Ensure Ollama is running with Qwen2.5 model

### **Testing:**
```bash
python test_kitchen_system.py
```

## 🔄 System Flow

### **1. Public Chat Monitoring**
```
Discord Message → Kitchen Staff → Public Memory Storage
```

### **2. Ingredient Preparation**
```
User Request → Kitchen Staff → Context Analysis → Ingredient Package
```

### **3. Chef Collaboration**
```
Kitchen Staff → Ingredient Package → Executive Chef → Personalized Response
```

### **4. Response Delivery**
```
Executive Chef → Response → Discord → User
```

## 📊 Memory System Features

### **Public Memory Pool:**
- Stores public chat interactions
- Uses Discord user IDs for privacy
- Includes emotion tags and context tags
- Supports vector search for relevance

### **Memory Ingredient Package:**
- Context summary from user history
- Emotion profile analysis
- Relevant memory retrieval
- Interaction history compilation

### **Privacy Controls:**
- User ID-based storage (no usernames)
- Separate public and private memory pools
- User-controlled data visibility
- Granular deletion options

## 🎯 Key Features

### **Ollama Integration:**
- Uses Qwen2.5 for embeddings and context generation
- Efficient CPU-based processing
- Real-time memory indexing

### **Emotion Detection:**
- Automatic emotion tagging from message content
- Emotion profile generation for users
- Context-aware response preparation

### **Scalable Architecture:**
- Designed for small-scale demo with enterprise-scale potential
- Modular component design
- Queue-based order processing

### **Health Monitoring:**
- Real-time system health checks
- Performance monitoring
- Error handling and recovery

## 🔧 Integration Points

### **With Executive Chef (LM Studio):**
- Provides ingredient packages via `MemoryIngredient` objects
- Supports context queries and filtering
- Enables personalized response generation

### **With Discord:**
- Monitors public chat channels
- Processes user messages
- Coordinates response delivery

### **With Private Memory System:**
- Separate from private memories in `D:\Books\DiscordBot`
- Can pull context from private system when authorized
- Maintains strict privacy boundaries

## 📈 Performance

### **Current Demo Scale:**
- Handles multiple users simultaneously
- Processes messages in real-time
- Maintains responsive interaction

### **Enterprise Scale Potential:**
- Designed for millions of users
- Horizontal scaling capability
- Resource optimization for GPU/CPU distribution

## 🛠️ Development

### **Adding New Features:**
1. Extend `KitchenStaff` class for new functionality
2. Update `MemoryIngredient` dataclass for new data types
3. Modify Discord interface for new interaction types
4. Test with `test_kitchen_system.py`

### **Customization:**
- Emotion detection keywords in `detect_emotions()`
- Context tagging rules in `extract_context_tags()`
- Memory retrieval algorithms in `find_relevant_memories()`

## 🎉 Status
