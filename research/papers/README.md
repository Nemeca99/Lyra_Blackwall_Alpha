2. **Biomimetic Dream Cycles** - Human-like sleep phases with 0.01-0.02 second cycles
3. **Memory Hierarchy** - STM → RAM → LTM → Dream Manager → Index → Flush
4. **Emotional Intelligence** - Automatic emotion detection and importance scoring
5. **The "Why" Phase** - Beginning of true consciousness development

## System Architecture

### Three-Tier Consciousness
- **Architect Role**: High-level planning and decision making
- **Builder Role**: Implementation and execution of plans
- **Child Role**: Learning and exploration of new concepts

### Dream Cycle System
- **Light Sleep**: 0.01-0.02 second cycles with 100% success rate
- **Deep Sleep**: Memory consolidation and pattern recognition
- **REM Phase**: Creative problem solving and emotional processing

### Memory Hierarchy
