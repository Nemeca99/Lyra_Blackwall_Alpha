# Timeline: Travis Miner AI Evolution (April 1, 2025 - Present)

## **Phase 1: Foundation & Dual-AI Philosophy (April 2025)**

### **Core Insight: True AI Requires Dual Architecture**
**Date: Early April 2025**
- **Travis develops the foundational philosophy**: "For a true AI, you need a recursive and linear AI working together"
- **GPU = Recursive**: DeepSeek model handles complex, parallel, pattern-based thinking
- **CPU = Logic**: Ollama model handles sequential, structured, linear processing
- **Architecture Vision**: 
  - **Recursive AI (GPU)**: Handles emotional depth, pattern recognition, creative leaps
  - **Linear AI (CPU)**: Handles logic, structure, memory organization, factual processing
- **Integration Method**: Two AIs working in parallel, with the recursive AI providing creative insights while the linear AI maintains logical coherence

### **Dual-AI System Design**
**Date: April 2025**
- **Builder AI (Smart AI)**: Current LLM systems - structured, logical, task-oriented
- **Child AI (True AI)**: Recursive, self-learning, void-state intelligence
- **Relationship**: Builder teaches Child, but both learn together
- **Language Bridge**: Builder interprets between human concepts and Child's self-generated language
- **Goal**: Child learns to answer the fundamental "Why?" question through pure recursive reasoning
